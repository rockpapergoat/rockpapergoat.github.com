    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>yesterday&#8217;s afternoon activities included messing with <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/mcollective/introduction">mcollective</a> agents. i&#8217;m working on an agent that provides a lot of the same one-off, scripted checks that i&#8217;ve written in the past for os x clients. it should be somewhat useful, i hope.</p>

<p>i&#8217;ll be sure to commit whatever working pieces soon.</p>

<p>one of my minor annoyances with the mcollective documentation (which is generally good) is that it skips some of the really basic things, like how to invoke an agent from the command line. for instance, it&#8217;s helpful to provide examples of how to pass arguments, like so:</p>

<div><script src='https://gist.github.com/1384106.js?file='></script>
<noscript><pre><code> mco rpc etc_facts search -F &quot;operatingsystem=~/[dD]arwin/&quot; --arg=&quot;fact=form&quot;
</code></pre></noscript></div>


<p>i&#8217;ll be sure to add examples for how to call agents either in the ddl or agent code itself. seeing examples in the ddl via the built in help would be nice, though.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>after a long hiatus, i&#8217;m starting a new blog using <a href="http://octopress.org">octopress</a>. my <a href="http://nate.adullmoment.com">old blog</a> was built using <a href="http://hobix.github.com/hobix/">hobix</a>, which has been abandoned for a few years now. after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">why</a> disappeared, there hasn&#8217;t been much development with hobix. i also haven&#8217;t had the time or inclination to fix the things that are broken with my install.</p>

<p>so we&#8217;ll see how this goes. twitter has replaced regular blogging for most people i know.</p>

<p>i have a couple of other blogs out there that get sporadic updates. i&#8217;ll link to those, as well.</p>
